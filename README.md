## About

Display discord DM and mention notifications using XSOverlay Notification API with [XSONotifications_py](https://github.com/StandB/XSNotifications_py) and a discord.py selfbot to read all messages (for now)

## Using
The user token is set with an ENV variable

use `set TOKEN=token_here` (without any quotes around the token)

`python main.py`

with XSOverlay running on the latest version

### Notes
Heavy WIP :)

## About

Display discord DM and mention notifications using XSOverlay Notification API with [XSONotifications_py](https://github.com/StandB/XSNotifications_py) and a discord.py selfbot to read all messages (for now)

`Automating user accounts is technically against TOS, use at your own risk!`

## Using
Download & launch xsnoti_discord.exe from the [Releases](https://github.com/StandB/XSNotifications_discord) page. (Store it somewhere safe)

It asks for a token on first launch, fill this in and it will remember.

Don't seperate token.txt and the exe file. If you type it wrong, change it manually in the txt file.



Or use python to run and type:

`python main.py`

with XSOverlay running on the latest version
